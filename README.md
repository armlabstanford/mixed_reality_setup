# Setting Up ROS-Unity-Hololens
1. Requirements for using [Hololens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/using-the-hololens-emulator) 1 or 2 emulator:
   - **Requirements**: Windows 10 Enterprise, Pro, or Education
	- Windows 10 Home will NOT work because [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/) is required for Hololens Emulator.
	- If you are from Stanford, you can obtain a free copy of Windows 10 Education from [here](https://stanford.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx). Sign in (top right) with your SUNet ID and search for "windows 10 education" in the top box. Add to cart and check out, you should obtain a product key.

Note: If you already have Windows 10 installed in your machine, you can simply upgrade to Windows 10 Education by manually entering in the product key as listed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/upgrade/windows-10-edition-upgrades#upgrade-by-manually-entering-a-product-key).

2. [Turning on Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v#enable-the-hyper-v-role-through-settings)
   - Under Windows search, type **Turn Windows Features on or off**.
   - Select **Hyper-V** and click **OK**.
   - You should be prompted to restart your Windows.
   -  You need to have Hyper-V enabled to be able to run the emulator so do not use a virtual machine. It will not work. [Why?](https://seriouscodeblog.wordpress.com/2017/02/21/and-you-can-write-hololens-apps-in-macos-linux-too-part-1/)
   -  To enable Hyper-V go to windows search and type: "Turn Windows features on or off" and enable Hyper-V
   -  Make sure to enable virtualization in the BIOS of your windows machine.
		
3. Follow tool instructions one by one. If one of them fails there is something going wrong: 
   -  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/install-the-tools
   -  Once you install the emulator successfully, go to visual studio 2019. Getting to this point is the hardest part. Create a new project using DirectX 11 as shown below:
   <a href="https://ibb.co/vDWKZLj"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/qx8Pkmr/VS2019.png" alt="VS2019" border="0"></a>
   - If the option does not appear you are missing libraries. Launch the Visual studio installer and add the proper workloads. Refer to the [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/install-the-tools) in the **Visual Studio Workloads** section. 
   - Follow the instructions of these [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ImaZ_Aqe3I) Minute 2:00 to pull up the emulator.
		
		
4. When installing Unity use the 2018.4 version to avoid conflicts: 
   - Install [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases?version=2018.4)
   - Install [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download ). Good interface to install dependencies: 
   - Get [Unity setup for hololens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYx4qIqi0oI). The video does not show you everything, but the narrator does explain the process properly. **NOTE:** UWP = Windows Store
   - Install [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases) packages:
   - Create a new project in unity.
	- In Unity select Assets, Import Package, Custom package (selected the downloaded package)
	- Follow this strict order else it will not work:
			Under Assets, [download](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases/tag/v2.2.0):
      - Microsoft.MixedRealityToolkit.Unity.Foundation.unitypackage
      - (Optional) Microsoft.MixedRealityToolkit.Unity.Extensions.unitypackage
      - (Optional) Microsoft.MixedRealityToolkit.Unity.Tools.unitypackage
      - (Optional) Microsoft.MixedRealityToolkit.Unity.Examples.unitypackage
      - (Optional,Â ExperimentalMicrosoft.MixedRealityToolkit.Unity.Providers.UnityAR.unitypackage

# Getting Started with ARCORE-Unity-Android Development

For ARCORE-Unity-Android Development refer to android branch.


# Getting started with [ROS#](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp)
[ROS#](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp) is a open-source library that allows us to communicate with [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) from [Unity](https://unity.com/), a game engine that is used to develop augmented reality content such as Microsoft's [Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens). 

This section is adapted from the [official page](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp) of the ROS# library. A detailed tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/wiki).

**Requirements**: Windows 10 Enterprise, Pro, or Education
- Windows 10 Home will NOT work because [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/) is required for Hololens Emulator.
- If you are from Stanford, you can obtain a free copy of Windows 10 Education from [here](https://stanford.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx). Sign in (top right) with your SUNet ID and search for "windows 10 education" in the top box. Add to cart and check out, you should obtain a product key.

*Note*: If you already have Windows 10 installed in your machine, you can simply upgrade to Windows 10 Education by manually entering in the product key as listed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/upgrade/windows-10-edition-upgrades#upgrade-by-manually-entering-a-product-key).

## Software installation
1. [Turning on Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v#enable-the-hyper-v-role-through-settings)
   - Under Windows search, type **Turn Windows Features on or off**.
   - Select **Hyper-V** and click **OK**.
   - You should be prompted to restart your Windows.

2. Creating network switch
   - Open **Hyper-V Manager**. Under **Action** on the top tab, click on **Virtual Switch Manager**.
   - Create a **Internal** virtual switch and name it **InternalSwitch**. Proceed with the default settings.

3. Enabling internet connection in virtual machine
   - Under **Control Panel**, open **Network and Internet** then **Network and Sharing Center**.
   - Select an active internet connection and click on **Connections**.
   - Under **Properties**, click on the **Sharing** tab. **Allow other network users to connect through this computer's network connection** and select **vEthernet (InternalSwitch)** in Home networking connection.

4. [Installing Ubuntu on Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/quick-create-virtual-machine)
   - If you prefer to install a VM such as  instead of using Hyper-V, skip to *Step 6*.
   - Under Windows search, open up **Hyper-V Quick Create**
   - Under operating system, select **Ubuntu 18.04**.
   - Under **More options**, change the network to **InternalSwitch**.
   - Click on **Create Virtual Machine**.
   - Remember the username and password that you set as it will be required later on.
   
   **IMPORTANT**: While you are setting up Ubuntu, **DO NOT** select the *Log In Automatically* option when creating your user account. If you are confused, check out this [link](https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-run-ubuntu-linux-in-an-enhanced-hyper-v-session/) for a screenshot. 
   
5. Starting your virtual machine
   - When you connect to Ubuntu, a prompt for the **Display configuration** will appear. Leaving it as **1366 by 768 pixels** is fine.
   - A *xrdp prompt* will appear. Under **Session**, select **Xorg**. The username and password is your Ubuntu's login credentials.
   - Proceed to *Step 7*.

6. Installing a VM instead of using Hyper-V
   - A popular open source Virtual Machine (VM) is Oracle's [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) that can be downloaded for free. Alternatively, Stanford provides another VM known as [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) (Fusion on Mac, Workstation on Windows/Linux). To install VMWare, go to this [link](https://stanford.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx) and sign in (top right) with your SUNet ID. Search for "VMware" in the top box and download the respective version for your OS.
   - To install Ubuntu, a guide for VirtualBox can be found [here](https://brb.nci.nih.gov/seqtools/installUbuntu.html).

7. Setting up ROS on Ubuntu
   - Follow this [link](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu) to install ROS on your virtual machine.

8. Configuring your ROS environment
   - Follow this [link](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment) to set up your `catkin_ws`.

9. Setting up [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/)
```
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
$ wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install gazebo9
$ sudo apt upgrade
```

10. Installing `rosbridge-suite`
   ```
   $ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosbridge-server
   $ git clone https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp.git ~/Desktop/ros-sharp
   ```
   - Place the `file_server` package (found under `Desktop/ros-sharp/ros`) in the `src` folder of your Catkin workspace, then build by running `$ catkin_make` from the root folder of your catkin workspace. (Your catkin workspace is found in the home directory of the Ubuntu VM, and is usually called catkin_ws).

11. Installing [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
   - Download Visual Studio 2019 Community from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
   - During the installation, include the following workloads under Desktop & Mobile:
     - .NET desktop environment
     - Desktop development with C++
     - Universal Windows Platform development

## Building your first Hololens app and communicating with ROS

### Current set-up:
- Host OS: Windows 10 Education
- [Ubuntu 18.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) running on [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/)
- [Unity 2018.4.x](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
- [Visual Studio 2019 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [Windows SDK 18362](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/)

*Note*: You'll have to complete the set-up described [above](#software-installation) before continuing with this section.

1. Obtaining the sample ROS files
   - Download and extract this repository.
   - Place the `box-ros` and `gazebo_simulation_scene` package in the `src` folder of your Catkin workspace in Ubuntu, then build by running `$ catkin_make` from the root folder of your catkin workspace. (Your catkin workspace is found in the home directory of the Ubuntu VM, and is usually called catkin_ws).
   - In the directory `gazebo_simulation_scene/scripts` make the file `update_pose.py` executable by running
   ```
   chmod +x update_pose.py
   ```

2. Obtaining the sample Unity project
   - Download the sample `Box` project [here](https://stanford.box.com/s/0560555c6t0ryglhkl8lyaaqbo12q54v). Open this project in Unity.

3. Modifying build settings in Unity
   - In Unity, under `File`> `Build Settings` > `Platform`, select `Universal Windows Platform` and use the following setup:
	 - Target Device: `Any device`
	 - Architecture: `x86`
	 - Build Type: `D3D`
	 - Target SDK Version: `10.0.18362.x`
	 - Minimum Platform Version: `Latest installed`
	 - Visual Studio Version: `Latest installed`
	 - Build and Run on: `Local Machine`
	 - Build configuration: `Release`
   - Click on `Switch Platform`.

4. Modifying project settings in Unity
   - In Unity, under `Edit`> `Project Settings` > `Player`, select the Windows icon. 
   - Under `XR Settings`, ensure that the following is checked:
     - `Virtual Reality Supported`
   - Under `Other Settings` > `Configuration`, select the following:
     - Scripting Runtime Version: `.NET 4.x Equivalent`
     - Scripting Backend: `IL2CPP`
   - Under `Publishing Settings` > `Capabilities`, ensure the following options are checked:
     - `InternetClientServer`
     - `PrivateNetworkClientServer`
     - `SpatialPerception`
     - `RemoteSystem`
 
5. Opening the scene in Unity
    - In the `Assets` folder, there should be a scene named `box`. Double click on it within Unity to open the scene.
    - On the left, you should be able to see an object named `RosConnector`. This helps us communicate with ROS when the app is deployed on Hololens. Click on `RosConnector`
    - On the right, you will see that this object contains `Ros Connector (Script)` and `Point Publisher (Script)`.
    - `Point Publisher (Script)` is a script that helps to publish information from Hololens to ROS. A separate script must be written for different ROS message type. In this case, `Point Publisher (Script)` publishes a [Point Message](https://docs.ros.org/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Point.html). The topic that is published can be changed under `Topic`. In this case, the message is published to `/point` topic.
 
6. Modifying ROS Connector
    - `Ros Connector (Script)` is used to change the IP address of our Ubuntu OS that is deployed in Hyper-V. Find the IP address of your Ubuntu OS by using the `$ ifconfig` command in an Ubuntu terminal. If your Network Adapter was set-up correctly in Step 4 during the [installation phase](#software-installation), you should see the IP address listed under `eth0`. For example, it could be `inet 192.168.137.66`.
    - Copy and paste this IP address in `Ros Connector (Script)` > `Ros Bridge Server Url` and append `port 9090`. For example, it could be `ws://192.168.137.66:9090`.
    - Under `Protocol`, ensure that `Web Socket UWP` is selected.
    
7. Building the Hololens App from Unity
    - We are finally ready to build the app.
    - Under `File` > `Build Settings`, ensure `Universal Windows Platform` is selected as the build platform and click on `Build`. When the prompt for the file location appears, select the `App` folder and click Select Folder.

8. Running ROS in Ubuntu
   - Open terminal in Ubuntu and run the following command:
   ```
   $ roslaunch box-ros box.launch
   ```

9. Running the Hololens App
    - Under the `App` folder of your project, you should now see a `Box.sln`. Double click on it to open it in Visual Studio.
    - In Visual Studio top menu bar, change to `Release`, `x86` and `HoloLens Emulator 10.0.x`. Then click on the green Play button located on the left of `HoloLens Emulator 10.0.x`.
    - Once the emulator is running, you should see `Client connected.  1 clients total.` in your Ubuntu terminal.
    - Use the arrow keys (to move user's gaze) and WASD (to walk around) in the emulator and find the red box. Using your spacebar, you can pick the box and place it elsewhere by using the spacebar to drop it off. The location of the box in Gazebo should also update as you move the box around.

## Troubleshooting tips
**Q: I managed to build the HoloLens app and run it in the emulator but it is not connecting with ROS.**

**A**: Ensure that `Web Socket UWP` is selected in Unity (under your current scene > `ROSConnector` > `Protocol`). The original [ROS#](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp) is written for NET application whereas HoloLens is a UWP platform. Luckily, there is a UWP version of ROS# [here](https://github.com/dwhit/ros-sharp) which has been imported into the sample Unity `Box` project found in this repository. If you are interested, read this [thread](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/issues/33) for more information.

**Q: My HoloLens client is connected to ROS but no message is being transmitted.**

**A**: This is a known issue faced by other users as well as seen in [here](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/issues/201) and [here](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/issues/33). The suspected reason is because of `Newtonsoft.Json` and `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` found under `\Box\Assets\RosSharp\Plugins`. 

A quick fix is proposed by other users:
- Download `JSON .NET For Unity` [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/json-net-for-unity-11347).
- Import it into your project folder, BUT only select `Newtonsoft.Json.XML` and `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` under `AOT`.
- Copy and paste these 2 files from the `AOT` folder into `\Assets\RosSharp\Plugins` folder.
- Delete the `AOT` folder to prevent multiple copies of `Newtonsoft.Json.XML` and `Newtonsoft.Json.dll`.

**NOTE**: You shouldn't have to do this if you are using the sample Unity `Box` project found in this repository as it has already been replaced.
